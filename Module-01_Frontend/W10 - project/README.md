# PROJECT

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Build a responsive website using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Use different layout properties like Flexbox and positioning when needed
- Deploy a live website to Netlify using Git

## Introduction to the Project 1

In this project, you‚Äôre going to be building and deploying your first fully responsive website using the technologies you‚Äôve learned so far: HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## Technical Requirements

For this project, you‚Äôll have to recreate a pre-existing design using your HTML & CSS skills. You‚Äôll also have to create a few interactions with the DOM, using what you‚Äôve learned about JavaScript so far.

Finally, you‚Äôll have to deploy this project to Netlify, using the Git CLI to do so. When you‚Äôre finished, you‚Äôll have your first website live and ready for anyone to interact with it!

At a minimum, you should meet the following technical requirements:

- Your website should be rendered in a browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Have a repo on GitHub
- Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it
- Be deployed online using Netlify so that anybody can access it
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principles
- Replicate the pages where the design files have been supplied using HTML and CSS
- Ensure your website is responsive
- Implement any functionality on your website using JavaScript
- Create a README file that covers all of the application‚Äôs features, configuration and specifications
- **BONUS:** For extra credits, add some additional functionality to your website beyond the scope of this brief. e.g. a working 404 page

## Tips for success üöÄ

- Be careful not to duplicate your code in any other language. E.g. if you create functionality in JavaScript, don‚Äôt duplicate this in HTML/CSS
- Write clean, modular and efficient code following best practices
- Name your folders and files clearly and consistently
- Apply indentation conventions to your source code and name your functions and variables logically
- Remove any unused code from your source code
- Use separate git branches for development and deployment

## Deliverables

- The URL of the GitHub repository for your project
- The URL of the live website on the Internet
- The URL of the slides for your project presentation
- You must present your project during the Project 1 presentations

## Project assets

For this project, you‚Äôll have access to the following assets:

- A [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) design that you will have to turn into a live, responsive website. This design also includes a few specifications regarding fonts and colors
- A folder with all the images you will need for this project.

You can download all assets from the following [project assets Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s48zMkVPVFViY2Go1H6_4prQ3sAS--FV?usp=sharing).

## Project description

You‚Äôll be building a website for a fictional web design company. This includes a few pages:

- A home page
- A project page and
- A contact page with a form.

Some of the challenges you‚Äôll have to complete will be the following:

- Adding navigation between the pages
- Making all the fields in the contact form required before being able to submit it
- **(Bonus)** Adding animations to different sections, like the ‚Äúrecent projects‚Äù cards

## JavaScript functionality

You‚Äôll need to use JavaScript to implement some of the functionality on the website. Here are some basic instructions:

- Using [this endpoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironhack-jc/mid-term-api/main/projects), fetch the first three projects of the API to display on the website in the expected position. This API returns the projects in descending order, so you can assume the first item of the array is the last project.

- Create a folder named `projects` with a file named `1.html` inside.
- Inside this file, you should fetch the API using the `onload` event. Use [MDN - Window: load event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event) if you need help.
- Filter the project with `uuid 1` and print the name, description, content, image and `completed_on` in the expected position of the page.
- Other projects should be other projects of the API. For example, if you are filtering the project with `uuid 1`, other projects must be others.

- **BONUS:** Take three other projects randomly. If the project does not exist in the API, you should alert the user.

- Validate the form using JavaScript (in addition to the required and type of the input) by showing an alert if the name is equal to "ironhack". E.g. ‚ÄúYou cannot be Ironhack, because I am Ironhack.‚Äù In addition, you can create more filters such as incorrect email, required fields not set, etc.

You can refer to [W3 Schools - JS Validation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp) for help with this.

- **BONUS:** Create a responsive menu. When clicked, toggle the menu.

## Setup

Besides your usual IDE, you will need to create a Figma account in order to open up the design that you‚Äôre going to replicate. Creating an account is completely free.

We recommend you download the desktop Figma app for this project. Once you‚Äôve created your account and downloaded the software, you just need to [import the `.fig` file](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114-Import-files-into-Figma) you‚Äôll see inside the Assets folder and you‚Äôll be set.

To review the basics of Figma, you can watch this [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/).

### Quick summary on how to use Figma
During a real-world web development project, most of the time you‚Äôll have to use the design file you get in order to build a website. Here are some of the tasks you‚Äôll have to do in most of your projects:

- Export the assets you‚Äôre going to use.
- Review styles (sizes, margins, fonts, colors, etc.).

Before starting the project, you should review the basics of Figma just so you know exactly how to use it in order to create your first responsive website.

## Web responsiveness

As is the case with most professional projects, for this task you‚Äôve received a design prepared for a desktop screen. However, as you know by now, you always need to keep mobile devices in mind.

One of the main challenges of this project is to adapt the existing design to all screen sizes. **You are free to modify any aspect of the website as you see fit in order to make it compatible with mobile devices.**

## Deployment

The last task of this project is to actually deploy your website once it‚Äôs completed. For this particular project, we‚Äôll be using **Netlify**, a static web page hosting service.

Deploying to Netlify is pretty simple: you just need to create an account, connect it to your GitHub repository, enter a few commands in your CLI and you‚Äôre good to go.

[Here‚Äôs a guide](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/) showing you how to deploy a static website using this service that you can follow once your project is completed.

## Rubrics

In order to assess your project and ensure all requirements are met, a **rubric** will be used. This rubric is used to **evaluate your project** by your teaching staff but also to **communicate** what constitutes incomplete, acceptable and excellent performance across each of the learning outcomes for this project. Take some time to review the rubric and ask your lead teacher any questions about it if necessary.
